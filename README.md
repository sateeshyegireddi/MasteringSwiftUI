# MasteringSwiftUI

## What You Will Learn in This Book

We will dive deep into the SwiftUI framework, teaching you how to work with various UI elements, and build different types of UIs. After going through the basics and understanding the usage of common components, we will put together with all the materials you've learned and build a complete app.

As always, we will explore SwiftUI with you by using the "Learn by doing" approach. This new book features a lot of hands-on exercises and projects. Don't expect you can just read the book and understand everything. You need to get prepared to write code and debug.
